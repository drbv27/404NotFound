<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/drbv27/404NotFound/blob/main/assets/img/thumbnail1.PNG)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
  The site demo it's [here](https://laughing-hopper-e272ac.netlify.app/)

- What was your experience?
Initially I tried to do it with CSS Grid first, but this was a real headache. Then I thought about doing it with Flexbox and MediaQ, and found that I didn't remember practically anything about it; so I had to review a bit. I am not an expert in GitHub, so this work helped me a lot to review the use of Git. Very good exercise to review a lot of CSS.

- What have you learned/improved?
CSS, Flexbox, MediaQueries
